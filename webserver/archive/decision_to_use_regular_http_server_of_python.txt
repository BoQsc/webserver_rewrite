Okay, with "strict adherence to no third-party libraries" and "prioritizing
  simplicity and clarity" as our guiding principles, we need to make a pragmatic
   choice.

  Achieving a fully asynchronous HTTP server using only the Python standard
  library, without introducing significant complexity by manually implementing
   the HTTP protocol, is not directly possible. The http.server module, which
  is the standard library's HTTP server, is inherently synchronous.

  Therefore, to meet your priorities of no third-party libraries and
  simplicity/clarity, the most straightforward approach for the HTTP server
  component itself is to use the synchronous http.server module.

  This means:
   * The HTTP request handling will be synchronous and multi-threaded (as
     http.server typically uses ThreadingMixIn with socketserver).
   * We can still use asyncio for other parts of our application, such as
     background tasks, service management (DDNS, SSL, etc.), and any other
     components that don't directly involve serving HTTP requests. This allows
     us to leverage asyncio where it provides clear benefits without
     complicating the core HTTP server.

  This approach prioritizes the clarity and simplicity of using a
  well-understood standard library component for HTTP, while still allowing us
   to build other parts of the system asynchronously.

  Does this revised plan align with your expectations for simplicity and
  clarity, understanding the trade-off for the HTTP server component?
